## v1.3 Requirements

### Dashboard Data Source

- [x] **DASH-01**: Dashboard shows all classes with "Deliveries" events from `classes.event_dates` JSONB
- [x] **DASH-02**: Dashboard statistics reflect delivery event counts (total, pending, completed)
- [x] **DASH-03**: Dashboard displays delivery task status (Pending/Completed from event_dates)
- [x] **DASH-04**: Dashboard shows class code, subject, client/site, start date for each delivery record

### Filtering & Actions

- [x] **FILT-01**: User can filter dashboard by delivery status (pending/completed)
- [x] **FILT-02**: User can search dashboard by class code, subject, or client name
- [x] **FILT-03**: Dashboard preserves existing cron notification type column (orange/red) where applicable

### Cron Integration

- [x] **CRON-01**: Existing cron notification system continues to work independently
- [x] **CRON-02**: Cron notification status shown as supplementary info on dashboard records

## Future Requirements

None identified.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Rewriting the cron notification system | v1.3 focuses on dashboard data source, cron stays as-is |
| Adding new event types | Dashboard shows existing Deliveries events only |
| Material tracking AJAX mark-as-delivered rework | Current AJAX action works for cron records, may need future attention |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| DASH-01 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| DASH-02 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| DASH-03 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| DASH-04 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| FILT-01 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| FILT-02 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| FILT-03 | Phase 19 | Complete |
