- [x] **ARCH-04**: View templates live in `views/clients/` using `wecoza_view()` helper
- [x] **ARCH-05**: JavaScript assets live in `assets/js/clients/` registered through wecoza-core
- [x] **ARCH-06**: Configuration merged into wecoza-core's `config/` structure
- [x] **ARCH-07**: Shortcodes registered through wecoza-core entry point (`wecoza-core.php`)
