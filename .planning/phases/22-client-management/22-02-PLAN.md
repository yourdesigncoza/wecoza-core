<objective>
Verify and fix all 15 AJAX endpoints for complete client CRUD functionality: create, read, update, soft-delete, search, filter, hierarchy management, CSV export, and statistics.

Purpose: Achieve functional parity with standalone wecoza-clients-plugin within wecoza-core architecture.
Output: All client management operations work end-to-end: form submission saves data, table displays it, delete soft-removes, export generates CSV, statistics show correct counts.

    Systematically test all 15 AJAX endpoints via WP-CLI to verify data flows correctly. Fix any issues discovered.

    **Step 0: Clear debug log**
    Truncate `/opt/lampp/htdocs/wecoza/wp-content/debug.log`

    **Step 1: Test client creation (wecoza_save_client)**
    Simulate AJAX call via WP-CLI:
    ```
    wp eval "
      wp_set_current_user(1);
      \$_POST = [
        'action' => 'wecoza_save_client',
        'nonce' => wp_create_nonce('clients_nonce_action'),
        'client_name' => 'Phase 22 Test Client',
        'company_registration_nr' => '2026/222222/07',
        'seta' => 'BANKSETA',
        'client_status' => 'Active Client',
        'contact_person' => 'Test Person',
        'contact_person_email' => 'test@example.com',
        'contact_person_cellphone' => '0821234567',
        'client_town_id' => 1,
        'financial_year_end' => '2026-02-28',
      ];
      // Call handler directly (not via AJAX to avoid wp_die)
      \$handler = new \WeCoza\Clients\Ajax\ClientAjaxHandlers();
    "
    ```
    - Check debug.log for errors
    - Verify client appears in database: query clients table for 'Phase 22 Test Client'
    - If save fails: check ClientsModel::save() method, column mapping, PostgresConnection::insert()

    **Step 2: Test client retrieval (wecoza_get_client)**
    - Verify ClientAjaxHandlers::getClient() returns client data for a known ID
    - Test ClientsModel::getById() returns correct fields
    - Test ClientRepository::find() if used

    **Step 3: Test client update (wecoza_save_client with existing ID)**
    - Send save request with `id` set to an existing client
    - Verify data updates in database
    - Check ClientsModel::update() method, column mapping for UPDATE queries

    **Step 4: Test soft-delete (wecoza_delete_client)**
    - Send delete request for test client
    - Verify database: client still exists with `deleted_at` timestamp set (NOT hard-deleted)
    - If hard-deleted: fix ClientAjaxHandlers::deleteClient() or ClientsModel::delete() to set deleted_at via UPDATE instead of DELETE
    - Key check: `ClientsModel::delete($id)` should do:
      ```php
      $data = ['deleted_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')];
      return wecoza_db()->update($this->table, $data, "id = :id", [':id' => $id]);
      ```
      NOT `wecoza_db()->delete($this->table, ...)`

    **Step 5: Test search and filter (wecoza_search_clients)**
    - Test search with a known client name substring
    - Verify results returned as array with expected fields
    - Test that soft-deleted clients are excluded (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)

    **Step 6: Test client hierarchy (wecoza_get_main_clients, wecoza_get_branch_clients)**
    - Test getMainClients: should return clients where main_client_id IS NULL
    - Test getBranchClients: given a main client ID, return sub-clients linked to it
    - Verify ClientRepository::getMainClients() and getBranchClients() queries filter correctly

    **Step 7: Test CSV export (wecoza_export_clients)**
    - Verify exportClients() handler sets correct headers (Content-Type, Content-Disposition)
    - Check CSV includes expected columns and data
    - Note: Cannot fully test via WP-CLI (needs HTTP response), but verify the method logic works

    **Step 8: Test statistics (getStatistics)**
    - Verify ClientsModel::getStatistics() returns counts by status and SETA
    - Confirm soft-deleted clients excluded from counts (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)
    - Check the statistics section renders in clients-table.view.php

    **Step 9: Test site management endpoints**
    - wecoza_save_sub_site: creates sub-site under a head site
    - wecoza_get_head_sites: returns sites where parent_site_id IS NULL
    - wecoza_get_sub_sites: returns child sites for a given parent
    - wecoza_delete_sub_site: removes sub-site
    - wecoza_get_sites_hierarchy: returns full tree
    - Verify SitesModel methods work with wecoza_db()

    **Step 10: Test location endpoints**
    - wecoza_get_locations: returns location hierarchy
    - wecoza_save_location: creates new location
    - wecoza_check_location_duplicates: checks for existing similar locations

    **Step 11: Verify form-to-AJAX data flow**
    - Check client-capture.js sends correct field names matching ClientAjaxHandlers::sanitizeClientFormData()
    - Check the nonce field name matches: `wecozaClients.nonce` in JS -> `clients_nonce_action` in PHP
    - Check field names in form views match $_POST keys expected by handlers

    **IMPORTANT per user decisions:**
    - Preserve existing behavior exactly -- fix bugs, don't redesign
    - Preserve manage_wecoza_clients capability checks
    - Test approach: WP-CLI for server-side, browser for client-side (next task)
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Client creation: `wp eval` creates client, appears in DB query
    2. Client retrieval: getById() returns correct data for known ID
    3. Client update: update persists changed fields in DB
    4. Soft-delete: deleted_at set, record still in DB, excluded from search results
    5. Search: returns matching clients, excludes soft-deleted
    6. Main/sub clients: hierarchy queries return correct parent-child relationships
    7. Statistics: counts by status/SETA, excludes deleted
    8. No PHP errors in debug.log after all tests
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 15 AJAX endpoints respond correctly. Client CRUD (create, read, update, soft-delete) works end-to-end. Search excludes deleted clients. Hierarchy queries return correct parent-child data. Statistics count correctly. Export handler generates valid CSV data.

  <name>Task 2: User verifies complete client management workflow in browser</name>
  <what-built>
    Complete Client Management system working within wecoza-core: CRUD operations, search, filter, pagination, hierarchy, CSV export, and statistics. All AJAX endpoints verified server-side.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    **Prerequisites:**
    - Standalone wecoza-clients-plugin DEACTIVATED
    - wecoza-core ACTIVE

    **Test sequence (in browser):**

    1. **Create client:** Visit [wecoza_capture_clients] page
       - Fill in: Company name, SETA, status, contact person details
       - Submit form
       - Expected: Success message, form clears (or redirects)

    2. **View clients:** Visit [wecoza_display_clients] page
       - Expected: Table shows the new client and existing clients
       - Test: Search by client name (type partial name, verify filtering)
       - Test: Filter by status dropdown
       - Test: Pagination if >10 clients

    3. **Edit client:** Click edit on a client (or visit [wecoza_update_clients]?mode=update&client_id=X)
       - Expected: Form pre-populated with client data
       - Change a field, submit
       - Expected: Success, changes visible in display table

    4. **Delete client:** Click delete on a test client
       - Expected: Confirmation dialog
       - Confirm delete
       - Expected: Client disappears from table (soft-deleted, not destroyed)

    5. **Client hierarchy:** If applicable, test creating a sub-client
       - Select a main client when creating new client
       - Verify sub-client appears under main client in the display

    6. **CSV export:** Click export button on display page
       - Expected: CSV file downloads with client data

    7. **Statistics:** On display page, verify statistics card shows:
       - Total client count
       - Breakdown by status
       - SETA breakdown (if shown)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all operations work, or describe specific failures with steps to reproduce</resume-signal>
