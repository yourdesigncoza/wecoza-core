# Phase 30 Plan 01: Agents Feature Parity Verification — SUPERSEDED

**Superseded:** Agents module integration was verified during Phases 28-29 (wiring-verification, feature-verification). The standalone wecoza-agents-plugin has long since been deactivated and the integrated module has been in production use through Phases 33+ without issues.
